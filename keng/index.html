I used to believe that there's no room for a great love in this world.
That love always equates to pain. 
But you proved the other way.
My heart feels so full because of you.
My body doesn't shake when there are storms for I am with you.
Even silence feels so light, even darkness looks so bright because of you.
When the weight drags me to the deepest, having you beside me and holding my hand is enough to keep me breathing.
To keep me alive. To keep me sane.
Love doesn't come as something grand and festive.
Sometimes, it is just a human body listening to your heartbeats.
Sometimes, it is us walking with all the lights above us.
Sometimes, it is just you looking at me in the eyes.
I know I am just a speck of dust in this vastness, yet you made me feel I am a universe.

I know I am just a speck of dust in this vastness, yet you made me feel I am a universe. 
I used to believe that there's no room for a great love in this world.

Sometimes, it is just you looking at me in the eyes.
I know I am just a speck of dust in this vastness, yet you made me feel I am a universe. 
I used to believe that there's no room for a great love in this world.
That love always equates to pain. 
But you proved the other way.
My heart feels so full because of you.
My body doesn't shake when there are storms for I am with you.
Even silence feels so light, even darkness looks so bright because of you.
When the weight drags me to the deepest, having you beside me and holding my hand is enough to keep me breathing.
To keep me alive. To keep me sane.
Love doesn't come as something grand and festive.
